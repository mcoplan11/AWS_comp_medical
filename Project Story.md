## Inspiration and Introduction
I have worked in the healthcare analytics space for about 10 years.  While I have a seen a tremendous amount of progress during this time, I still see many areas where advanced analytics could be utilized to improve patient outcomes.  One of the most underutilized data assets in healthcare is free text written in clinical notes.  Developing systems to better harvest and then operationalize this natural language data could result in earlier interventions and decreased healthcare costs. While highly data rich, this text is notoriously difficult to understand and process. 

Heart failure is the bad.  LVEF is an important measure that is needed to effectively treat HF patients, but it is often buried in clinical notes.

## What it does
Our product will read through medical charts and extract the LVEF of patients.  

## How we built it
We utilized a rule based extraction engine paired with AWS healthcare NLP. 

## Challenges we ran into
TBD

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Results

## What we learned


## What's next for Extraction of LVEF from medical chart text
We recommend listening this technology out to large providers networks.  This technology would give them the ability to rapidly iterate through their proprietary healthcare databases in order to extract structured LVEF data for the entire patient population.  The data could then be utilized for   A refined list of patients with LVEF within a certain range should be referred to cardiology for advanced heart failure treatment. 

Advanced heart failure patients often result in complex surgical intervention which is generally how large health systems generate a large share of their revenue.  **Not only will this solution improve quality of patient care, but healthcare systems are also financially incentivized to do this**.
